Project made on bachelor's degree. Uses technologies like: Java, JSF, JavaMail API, Hibernate, PrimeFaces and MySQL database running on XAMPP.
Database script used for creating database is inluced in file "Test database creation script.txt". It is possible to create database using Oracle SQL Developer, if using it, it is needed to download and install apropiate MySQL driver. Sometimes sessions and transactions could be handled better so it is not advisable to use it like in this project.

To send emails you will need to download and install mail server certificate for ssl connection and enter mail credentials. You can do this like in this tutorial: https://docs.bvstools.com/home/ssl-documentation/openssl. If you will be using xampp for running MySQL database it has also openssl included (ex: "J:\xampp\apache\bin\openssl.exe", you can also search for "openssl.exe" using windows search and type "openssl.exe"). After downloading certificate search for JDK folder path (ex: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144"). Open windows cmd as administrator and go to jdk folder. After that use command like: "bin\keytool -import -trustcacerts -keystore jre\lib\security\cacerts -storepass changeit -alias gmail03082019 -file path\to\certificate.cer". You can use another alias but it should be unique. After issuing this command in cmd you will see "Certificate was added to keystore". Next it may be necessary to restart computer to changes to take effect. In "SendMailSSLBean" there are two strings "username" and "password" that you need to change to your mail server credentials, they are used to accessing mail to send messages about subscribed items, payment information and info about sended shipments. The renewal of mail server certificate may be done programatically but it is not implemented. When emails are not send beacuse for example server says in Apache Tomcat output: "javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException: 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at
535 5.7.8  https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials h1sm14034092lfj.21 - gsmtp" or "javax.mail.AuthenticationFailedException" a culprit may be application sending emails too often and you may have to wait some time to make problem disappear, google says "If your mail app checks for new messages more than once every 10 minutes, the appâ€™s access to your account could be blocked.". If you are using two steps verification change password in "SendMailSSLBean" to your App Password, this link may be helpful "https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229#cantsignin".

In cmd:
to go to another drive just type it letter ex: "C:\" 
to list all folders and files in a folder use "dir" 
you can also use "tree" command but it may take some time to list all subfolders
to go to parent folder use "cd.."
to go to children folder use "cd folder_name", you can also use [Tab] to auto complete folder name
keep in mind that path with spaces should be contained in apostrophes ex: "C:\Program files\file.txt"
